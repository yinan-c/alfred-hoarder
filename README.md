# Hoarder Workflow

Hoarder (now [Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep)) is a self-hosted bookmark app with AI automatic tagging and full text search.

This workflow can list and full text search your bookmarks based on title, tags, description, cached content and note!

## Setup

This workflow requires Hoarder/Karakeep URL and its API key.

[Self-host](https://docs.karakeep.app/Installation/docker) your own instance or use [official instance](https://cloud.karakeep.app/signin).

Setup an API key on `{hoarder_url}/settings/api-keys`.

## Usage

`hoarder` + keyword to full text search, `hoard` to hoard (add links and notes).
